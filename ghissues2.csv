search broken and also needs to be enhanced and visible,"1 bug & ui enhancements with search:

1/ when searching, if something matches in the org review, the link is wrong. If there is an app with the same number as the org, then it goes to the wrong url. Otherwise generates a system error. This is because the org qandas follow app, but not all the way.

2/ the search functionality should be available to people not logged in (this is experimental, later we may disable showing of names to non-members or turn it off) - so the search menu should always be visible. 

3/ The text inside should say ""Search ..."" instead of the current ""Search Knowledge base"". This will help reduce the size - when nobody is logged in, the spaces is less.

4/ the search should have the following headings and subheadings (needs reordering from current and indenting of 2nd level headers):

  Project
    Project Reports
    Project Attachments
    Reviewer Reports <blank for now>

  Application

Like searching for:
- 'Martin' results in not finding Martin Strele one contact in Kairos
- 'Kairos' results in blank
- Kyrgyzstan which is mentioned in Kairos profile does result in Kairos

One thing: Org profile is not visible for anonymous members.. We should deal with it when somebody clicks from search.

Just one more fix in the new fix:

When non-logged in public is searching, under Org Contact it should say:
""This personal data can be searched by members only.""

1/ http://qa.peerwater.org/apps/74 shows many projects off one app and its very confusing in the small column

2/ some of the data on app status, etc is repeated from the top

lets put in a new tab (""Project Summary"") that is only visible if the application is funded. this tab will display the following items:

Assigned to review project app emails code mess up,"The automatic ""assigned to review the project application"" emails that are sent out after Admin assigns reviewers to project applications has a malfunction in the code for the first line.

The first line should read: You have been selected to review ''project application name'' by == Organization Name == to be considered for funding through Blue Planet Run's Peer Water Exchange.

Instead, it reads: You have been selected to review ''the project application'' by ''project application name'' to be considered for funding through Blue Planet Run's Peer Water Exchange.

The link is fine, it is just the text that has been messed up. I tested all the links and they work.

Here is an example: 
Dear Ned Breslin,

You have been selected to review the project application by test tuesday to be considered for funding through Blue Planet Run's Peer Water Exchange.

Kindly review the project details as soon as possible to give you and the team the most time to ask for clarifications and make suggestions.

You can use the Question & Answer forum to post any questions and comments on the application. These are visible to all the reviewers and the applicant; any of whom can respond to further comment on or clarify your observations. You will get an email notification when any comment or response is posted. If you have input regarding comments by your peers, please share it in the same forum.

Please note that the deadline to submit your final rating and comments is 17 June, 2008. Please submit your rating in time - click on the ""Ratings & Comments"" tab when you are ready.

You will find all the reviews assigned to you in the 'To Do' section of your PWX dashboard when you login to PWX.

Thank you in advance for your participation. Your expertise is what makes PWX work: eliminate bureaucracy, increase transparency, enable cooperation and knowledge-sharing, strengthen the world's first participatory decision-making system, and help scale up our work to reach millions who lack safe drinking water and sanitation.

Thank you,
The Peer Water Exchange Team

No. this is not possible.  Remember this is not a general purpose site search.  We are searching models or any other structured data.  If needed then I can add a Google Custom search to our whole website like we have in bpr.org.  But the current search is limited to searching models.

Google Custom search can not be used as of now because it can not integrate with ferret search. and having two different search pages would be crazy confusing

this needs more detailed requirements than the one liner.

what software do people use (word, etc.). do they want to cut and paste?

if they are away from internet, will they even have computers?

how will they create photo list offline and other attachments.

the simple way is to create a list of questions that they can print or download locally and use to answer questions. then when they get online, they can enter (or copy and paste).

rajesh needs to design the use case better.","10/10/11 10:34:25; rajesh; 
here is a first pass at a use case:

admin specifies a funder with a funding round. ideally with one or more funders.

each approved application (or project) inherits this funder.
however, that can be changed per project.
we could assign projects to non-pwx organizations (a runners club that raises money for one project or a rotary club). maybe a sub-group under a funder.

have reports for all projects|total by funder and sub-group by year.

what can we do now?
what can we do in our current architecture? (eg. add a funder field to each project)
what do we need to do by making wholesale changes?
","10/10/11 10:34:27; ajaya; 
we need to talk.","10/10/11 10:34:29; rajesh; 
refinement of use case:
in funding cycle specify at least 2 funders and a total amount.
(for now no need for individual amounts)

as each project is created, it inherits the first funder. admin can edit and specify another funder and amounts split between each funder.

here is the admin/ui part of the use case (reporting, accounting, auditing parts later):

1. List of funders
- all current orgs should show up in any list of funders available for selecting
- in addition 2 others need to be in the list: Other and Anonymous

2. Cycle
- provide ability select a number of funders (done, if complex, limit to 2)
- provide text box next to each funder for extra info (e.g. 30 Mile Challenge): <50 char (25 char is good, depends on space)
- amount allocated to each funder should total to funding round total (lowest priority- can be moved to later with reports)

3. Application, at time of approval
- inherit list of funders, and amounts can be assigned
- maybe non-zero funders with text (from text box) visible on app summary page after approval (lowest priority)

4. Project
- show funders and text (from text box)
- do not show amount for now
- do not need to make it editable for now

5. Orgs
- if org is funder, show list of projects funded in right column
- have another section (Funding) above Apps and Projects
- show total funding (layout finalized later)

6. Lists

here is the admin/ui part of the use case (reporting, accounting, auditing parts later):

1. List of funders - all current orgs should show up in any list of funders available for selecting - in addition 2 others need to be in the list: Other and Anonymous
    Done


2. Cycle - provide ability select a number of funders (done, if complex, limit to 2) - provide text box next to each funder for extra info (e.g. 30 Mile Challenge): <50 char (25 char is good, depends on space) - amount allocated to each funder should total to funding round total (lowest priority- can be moved to later with reports)

   Done

3. Application, at time of approval - inherit list of funders, and amounts can be assigned - maybe non-zero funders with text (from text box) visible on app summary page after approval (lowest priority)

   Already done. Try approving. Validation of numbers needed?

4. Project - show funders and text (from text box) - do not show amount for now - do not need to make it editable for now
   Already done. Edit a project and see at the end.  Currently displayed on the right column.  Suggest changes.

5. Orgs - if org is funder, show list of projects funded in right column - have another section (Funding) above Apps and Projects - show total funding (layout finalized later)
   Done.

6. Lists - list of projects by funder (low priority, just for consideration, no need to do it now)
