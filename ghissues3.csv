I think the best strategy clarifying the differences in types of Contact, and that you don't put one person's name as the first name and a second person's name as the last name for the Primary Contact, would be bubbles next to these two fields.

Project App. Page 3 appearing in italics in QA,"Couldn't get this to replicate in firefox, but in IE it looks like there's something wrong with Page 3 of the Project App.

Everything's in italics and the labels are not bold. This goes down all the way to the bottom of the page, including the copyright info for BPR and also the entire right hand column of the screen (all the Application Summary Info.)

  title: Community Handover Ceremony
  body: ""I attended the official handing over to the community of Mosasa water project from Rotary International at Kisii Hospital on 15 November 2008. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    The day began by a 5K walk around Kisii town to involve the greater community and to celebrate this mystery of life \xE2\x80\x93 water! This was followed by the official opening of the project by the Deputy Mayor of Kisii, Mr. Kennedy, then refreshments, entertainment, speeches and lunch. It was indeed colorful as dancing and singing rocked the grounds of Kisii town and its neighborhoods. The entire hospital staff was welcoming and we had guests who came from within and outside Nyanza province and all the way from the USA who witnessed this colorful day in Kisii town. We were pleased that several members of the Rotary club of Hurlingham could join us: Ken Idwasi with his two sons, Remmy Koech and his wife and Ms. Ndila a friend of the club.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Everyone was pleased for this day, to celebrate this amazing achievement at Kisii Hospital. It was very great to see the water project, the pump and the store house and how much people are benefiting in the hospital. Great thanks goes to all who participated in funding this project lead by Rotary club of Hurlingham, Rotarian Don Howard and his team from Colorado USA, Blue Planet Run Foundation and many others who donated in aid of this successful project.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Kisii fraternity asked me to send a lot of wishes and THANK YOU to the BPRF for your support. \r\n\
    God bless,\r\n\

      technology_used: There is a spring located approximately a mile from the hospital that has sufficient flow, as tested by several water engineers, to provide in excess of 300,000 litres of water per day to the hospital and to the nearby community. The spring is on public property and approval to use it for the hospital and community has been obtained. The cost of protecting the spring, pumping it to the hospital, establishing access to the community and providing security is $65,500. The hospital has maintenance personnel trained to operate and maintain the equipment and infrastructure required for the project. Maintenance funds will be generated by savings from no longer buying water from the municipal supply. This will also benefit the community by having more water available for businesses and household use. Specific details on the project plan have been developed and are available for review.

        Blue Planet Run will be prominently displayed as a partner with Rotary on a large plaque at the entrance of the hospital. There will be widespread publicity throughout the area and in Kenya's national news about the project and the role Blue Planet Run has played. It would also be good if some runners from Kenya are participating in the Run so they could be mentioned and thereby increase awareness of the upcoming event.
         
        The lead is Don Howard. He and his wife will be going to Kenya in April and August to visit the projects and document results through video interviews, pictures and reports. Local Rotary Clubs will be responsible for disbursing funds, monitoring results, maintaining records and solving problems.

        The 200 bed Kisii District Hospital, in the western Kenya highlands,  was built in 1916 and has expanded through the years to accommodate 332 in-patients and a daily average of 500 out-patients. Bed occupancy ranges from 130% to 230% during the past ten years and has gone as high as 550% during times of malaria outbreaks. The hospital serves 525,000 people directly and is a referral facility for an additional 2,430,000. The Kisii area has a high density of AIDS victims and is known for the prevalence of the deadly highlands malaria after the rainy season.
        
        The hospital's water needs are 180,000 litres per day. If all systems are functioning properly, the hospital has 40,000 litres of water per day from the following sources: 15,000 from a borehole, 10,000 litres from water harvesting and 15,000 litres from the municipal water system. The municipal system was put in place 30 years ago when the hospital had 200 beds and the population of the area was a fraction of what now exists. The equipment frequently breaks down and the hospital goes long periods of time with only enough water to use for essential services. Outdoor latrines are used, sheets are not provided for beds, polluted river water is purchased from vendors to use for cleaning and doctors and nurses have little water to clean their hands after treating patients. Much more information about the terrible conditions at the hospital is available.

        comments: "".The mission of Rotary District 5450 Water Task Force is to encourage and support the 58 clubs in our District to assist  Rotary Clubs in other countries in developing, funding and completing clean water projects.  Funds are raised by clubs within the District through various fund-raising activities, private donations, applying for grants and partnerships with schools, churches and businesses. These funds are matched by District and the Rotary International Foundation. 100% of all funds go to support projects. Administrative expenses are borne by member donations to the Rotary Foundation. \r\n\
          \r\n\
          Our goal is to explore ways in which organizations such as the PEER Group, Blue Planet Run,  Global Run and Rotary can work togther to alleviate the world's water and sanitiation problems. ""
        history: ""Projects vary in size from shallow wells in India , bio-sand filters in Central America to providing multiple water and sanitation stations for the Kibera Slum in Nairobi. Projects vary in costs from a hundreds of dollars to $350,000. District 5450 has ungoing projects in Kenya, Thailand, India, Nicauragua, Peru, Equador, Afghanistan, Malaysia, Tanzania, Uganda, Cambodia and other countries. We work with the local community, NGO's, Water for People, Engineers Without Borders and local water engineers to implement projects. ""

    people_drinking_details: This number reflects the hospital staff and nursing school. The patient figures vary but will average about 600-800 daily. In addition, community members have access to a protected spring facility with excellent water quality. That portion of the project is completed and being extensively used throughout the day. Water is pumped to the hospital during the night. It is being routed to the laundry, kitchen, operating area, the ""amenities ward"" and will be available to the new 150 bed addition when it opens in the fall.
    maintainance_revenue: Maintenance funds will be derived from the savings generated by not using the municipal water system and water vendors. The District Water Engineer, who will supervise the project, will assist in training hospital maintenance personnel and do scheduled maintenance inspections.

    learnings: ""The schedule established for beginning the project was delayed because of the great number of water and other humanitarian projects processed by Rotary International Foundation at this time of year. It was further complicated by some missing details in the instructions for transferring funds. All funds were received, the community dug the trench to take the pipeline to the hospital, all materials were ordered and delivered expeditiously, and the progress has been satisfactory except for a long delay in the delivery of three-phase power. All parties worked together harmoniously and care was taken to install quality materials with an eye toward sustainability. The Host country sponsor, the Hurlingham Rotary Club, is located in Nairobi, a six hour journey to Kisii.  Coordination and supervision was difficult because of the distance involved. Attempts are being made to establish a Rotary Club in Kisii so that sustainability can easily be monitored.  ""
    people_other_details: ""In addition to  providing water to the hospital, the project has provided taps for the community to use and a place for washing clothes. Many women are using the protected spring area for washing clothes rather than the nearby and heavily polluted river. The protected spring is now a social meeting place. Small business stands selling fruit, vegetables and other products have sprung up and we observed one enterprising woman opening a hair washing and styling business at the spring site. ""

Until the plumbing is renovated, the hospital will not reap the full benefits of the project.

      \r\n\
      Blue Planet Run will be prominently displayed as a partner with Rotary on a large plaque at the entrance of the hospital and a second plaque at the community access area by the pumping station.. There will be widespread publicity throughout the area and in Kenya's national news and television about the project and the role Blue Planet Run has played. The participation of a Kenyan in the Blue Planet Run will also be featured.\r\n \r\n\
      The project is led by the Rotary Clubs of Conifer, Colorado and Hurlingham-Nairobi . Rotarians Carol Carper, Don Howard and his wife, Pat, visited the project in June,2007 and documented existing conditions through video, pictures and interviews. A follow up visit was conducted in June, 2008 to document progress. The Hurrlingham Rotary Club is disbursing funds, monitoring results, maintaining records and solving problems. Don Howard, his wife, Pat, Dr. Mogoa, Hospital Superintendent, political and civic dignitaries and a crowd of 300 gathered for the ground breaking ceremony. ""

tried to save this: 12.894739370132813, 77.7456521987915 but after saving it rounds off to: 12.894739, 77.745652
and shows on the map quite a bit far away.
more near:
12.842978123730507
77.69685745239258

so clearly not the rounding, but something else is a problem.

am explaining to funders how we are not funding some this year due to lack of project reports and lack of updates, even if the application peer review was good.

also, if reports are going to list projects overdue, we need good dates.

so: 
- nil first pref

project cost v amount allocated,"if i am confused by the amounts, i am sure others are.

can we clarify what is used in the project costs?

there is the amount allocated (shows up on 'program funding' projects) and project cost.

i want:
1/ amount allocated (is from the funding thru pwx)
2/ project cost (total cost of project, including funding from all sources)

#1 needs to be used by pwx to match app & proj (funding and execution) for both projects and programs

#2 is used to show total value of projects managed and needs to match / correlate with the total value of applications (shown on home page)

for AJ: #2 should not be used anywhere in internal calc
for RS: appropriate help and text is needed",10/10/2011 09:58:22,10/10/2011 10:44:25,Closed,rajesh,rajesh,Features for External Funders,Fixed,"10/10/11 10:44:18; rajesh; 
maybe i was not clear:

with all projects there should be an amount allocated (from the funding) - #1.

IDEAL Scene: you have an option to 'return' it and account for all the money.

With a single project, for now, it should show up as a difference between what was funded and what was used.

For program funding, it is used (currently) as a way to create another project, until it becomes zero.

photo slideshow,"when there are many photos in the list, it is hard to view all of them. when you view one, the order changes (the one you click on moves out, rest of photos move up, and the one previously viewed moves in).

show the title, the text also.

also from Jackie:

Thanks for updating us! PADI came through with flying colors concerning the photography. They look great.  I just had a user-interface thought regarding the photo organization. It would be nice to arrow throw all the photos if possible, versus having to click on each photo. I'm aware you and AJ are constantly updating the site so maybe this is something you can consider.

Abhishek restored the code from the analytix branch.

Here is the link he gave me: http://qa.peerwater.org/organizations/25-Tanzania-Mission-to-the-Poor-and-Disabled-PADI-/attachments/album

but we need:

1. a button or link from the attachments area for project / project report / org (optional)

2. controls to scroll

3. adjust speed (slow down from now, not necessarily user controlled)

4. center photos

5. increase bottom margin (lot of photos hang off the bottom)

Thank you for writing blockedbyearthlink@abuse.earthlink.net.  This is an automated response to the email you sent to this address.

PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE EMAIL TO RESOLVE YOUR ISSUE

This email address is only for those issues where EarthLink appears to be blocking a mail server and mail is returned with the the following error messages: ""550 Dynamic/zombied/spam IPs blocked.  Write blockedbyearthlink@abuse.earthlink.net"".

EarthLink may be blocking your mail server because the server is/was listed in a dynamic IP range, an open proxy, a compromised machine, or  major source of spam.

In order to help you with your issue we will need some information from you.  If you are the administrator of this mail server, please follow the instructions below before emailing us back.

If you do not know what IP address your server is sending with, please contact the mail administrator of your company or your ISP and  have them follow the instructions below.

If you are the administrator of the email server being blocked, please know you may be able to expedite unblocking by checking to see if your mail server is listed in the following lists and resolving before emailing us:

The CBL
http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi
This is a list of IPs that may be currently infected and sending spam unknowingly.

Spamhaus
http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/index.lasso
>From their website you will be able to query your IP to see if it listed in any of their 3 lists that track dynamic IPs, zombied IPs, and IPs that are known to purposely send spam.  EarthLink blocks IPs known to be dynamic, zombied, and purposely sending spam.

If your mail server/gateway IP is not on these lists, is not dynamic, and is not an open relay/proxy/zombie, please reply back to blockedbyearthlink@abuse.earthlink.net with  'BLOCKED <insert IP>' in  the subject line with the mail server/gateway IP inserted.    

Blockedbyearthlink@abuse.earthlink.net does not block any mail sent to it; so, if possible, please email us from the server in question.  All reports sent to this address, not using this format will receive this auto response.  This process will allow us minimize the amount of time to resolve any blocking issues.  Please note, any emails you send to us without the formatted subject lines are not kept.  If you included important information in that first unblock request, please make sure that information is included in your subject-formatted response.

Thank you for your cooperation,
EarthLink Abuse
