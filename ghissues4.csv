related to #8577

pwx is not supposed to be the fundraiser, but it needs to provide links to viewers to donate, to fund projects.

we could use the funder info in the cycle and provide a link in the bubble. when they click on it they go to the funder's website and their donate page.

other ideas? want to keep this thought alive.",10/10/2011 10:00:09,10/10/2011 10:00:09,Open,rajesh,ajaya,Wish List,Unresolved
ability to create links for projects/applicatons on map,"it would be sweet to send a link, for example:

pwx.org/map/proj/15

which opens up the map and highlights the project - bubble above project icon opens up

similarly

pwx.org/map/app/15/links

which opens up the map and the bubble for the app and also the links to reviewers

then we can set its priority and maybe do it, move it to 'Z Future' or can the idea.",10/10/2011 10:00:11,10/10/2011 10:47:14,Closed,rajesh,rajesh,Features for External Funders,Fixed,"10/10/11 10:47:08; rajesh;

See links on the right column under locations, address, country, etc under app, proj, org.","10/10/11 10:47:12; rajesh; 
this is good.

can we make it so that only one item is on the map?

if i find a project of 'project well' i see the bubble but when i try to find the actual location, its lost among several water drops.

so when the user clicks on 'show on map' it should only have one item on map.","10/10/11 10:47:14; ajaya;

funders projects in right column,"if an org is a funder, the projects it funded should appear in the right column.

(max 5)

when you click on 'More' there should be a report for those projects, just like for ""My Projects"" and ""My Active Projects""

maybe ""My Funded Projects""

how will others find this listing?

we need to discuss what projects makes the cut for this list!! cycles have funders, apps have funders, projects have funders.  for now apps & projects can have these fields null.  So. we need to have a staregy.  Let's talk.."
carryover implementer name from the app into the project,"there are 2 fields in the app for 'other implementer'

carry the name field over into the project on the main project report page.

the value should be inherited from application.

since this is a db change, lets make it soon and deploy to qa so we can test.

probably left overs.  it will get carried over if u create the project after these changes went in.

org count bugs,"admin dashboard: 44
click on admin 'organizations': 49
home page: 49
click on home page list: 7 funders, 31 imp, 5 observers, 6 propects = 49

so how come admin dashboard says 44 (if you take out prospects it should be 43)?
there are 2 in peer review so either 43 or 45, but 44 does not make sense.

also, is it possible to get rid of 'draft'? we should count them only after they 'come in' to the system. 'peer review'",10/10/2011 10:00:23,10/10/2011 10:47:37,Closed,rajesh,rajesh,Features for External Funders,Fixed,"10/10/11 10:47:31; ajaya; 
The ones in the admin screen were all junk. Some old leftovers.

I have cleaned it up.  I haven't excluded the drafts as for real numbers u can do to go home page. The number on admin page shows how many r there total.

On the org list (from About) now Anonymous and Other show up as Funders. They are placeholder orgs and both are confusing and add to the count.

Possible to remove them from that list and count?
","10/10/11 10:47:35; rajesh; 
want to design this 'Other' and 'Anonymous' funding sources right. 
is creating an org the right way to do it?

if we can't do it now, then we can push this out to the next release. 
this release has enough with multiple funders, so maybe back this stuff until we know what we are doing.","10/10/11 10:47:37; ajaya;

for now I have removed from list, count etc. see the code to see where I made changes.

if file name of attachment is too long it does not wrap text,"http://qa.peerwater.org/projects/161-wer/attachments?type=photo

in mozilla, if file name of attachment is too long it does not wrap text and hence the ""delete"" and ""edit"" buttons are cut off.  this is only true of file name, not of title or description.  also, the file name automatically inserts underscores (_) for spaces when uploaded, that is why the filename becomes too long.  true for all pages, apps, project, profile, etc.  limit is ~75 characters before cutting off delete and edit buttons.

#2509 code"
reports should come opened,"the status/visitor/peer reports blinds come collapsed and they collapse when you click on any report.

that means if there are multiple reports, you have to open the ""Report"" section each time.

1. best is not make this section non-collapse

2. if it is collapsible, if it is opened it should stay opened when you click a report
http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11233 had something about this

3. visitor report should stay open since we want visitors to easily submit reports and they might not find it if hidden (so #1 is best bet)

Reviewers also always receive emails from applications they are reviewing regardless of the preferences they have set.

enhance search to include reporter names and organizations,"Need to index search so that reporter names are also searched.

So, if we searched for 'scott' not only would all Q&A in which scott participated show up, but any reports filed by scott.

actually, the stuff works great!

the only problem is when a peer reviews the report - then the name is a link and not text and so does not get indexed.

so its a smaller problem to be solved but a greater fix.

at some point this should be fixed in the same way app-qandas are indexed"

12:07:37 PM AJ: but. we can see if an applicaton is peer reviewed or not by looking at if there was any review assigned for that app or now
12:07:38 PM AJ: not
12:08:41 PM Rajesh Shah: not always true. when someone applies for 5 of the same type of projects, only one is peer reviewed, and the others inherit the result of the first. but its clear that that type of project was peer reviewed
12:10:28 PM AJ: then let's create something in the app that shows that it is inhertiting review from some other app. 
12:10:43 PM AJ: just some random flag on a app is problem
12:11:50 PM Rajesh Shah: with that flag on the q&a tab, we can also add: ""This app was presented directly to the funder by the implementer, not requiring peer review""
12:12:16 PM Rajesh Shah: we can also disable the ratings tab
12:12:32 PM Rajesh Shah: its not a random flag, but quite insightul
12:14:15 PM AJ: here is what I am coming from. . If you have some functionality that you thing PWX can provide, then we need to make it part of PWX in more structured  way from data perspective. so.  If we have an app that doesn't need Peer Review, then thats a feature and we define something like app requrierements and peer review would be one of them and set to off for the one not needing one. 
12:14:38 PM AJ: so . we can code in such way that we can check if peer review is needed or not  and do whatever. 
12:15:03 PM AJ: but having a flag. that implies peer review inherited is quite diff from peeer review not needed
12:15:29 PM AJ: so a hack should be avoided as much if we can formalize the needed
12:15:31 PM AJ: needs
12:16:59 PM Rajesh Shah: i like that. and its almost what i am looking for. when a non-peer reviewed app comes in (eg. GV) i skip the 'distribute app' and jump to the 'enter final status'

since these are manual and i don't see even after WOTR, a need to add programming, lets keep it simple
12:17:39 PM Rajesh Shah: we can add a 'needs peer review' flag - its the same as 'peer reviewed' but if it makes you happy ...
12:17:56 PM AJ: no. no. not about me being happy. 
12:18:14 PM AJ: I am debating the approaches. 
12:18:44 PM AJ: just saying what u said earlier. and trying to make sense
12:19:46 PM Rajesh Shah: all i am saying, for now it can be manual process to go back and mark all GV apps that are not peer reviewed. then we can at least use the total of peer review amounts.

later we can add code to streamline process if we have to handle many apps
12:20:44 PM AJ: why not just count the amounts now and update the amounts manually. easier then making hacks in the DB
12:21:48 PM Rajesh Shah: well, i also wanted to change the tabs (q&a, ratings) text for people looking thru apps

I think I mentioned this before, but didn't send the examples.
Some hover-over bubbles on the map for certain locations take you to a completely different place on the map when clicked.

I don't know what query you are talking about.  The following one as u said yesterday returns 69 results.

","10/10/11 10:54:23; rajesh; 
the org count via sql gives 69 results.
there are duplicates due to two offices in some orgs.
eliminating the duplicates should give 59 - it gives 60.
so there is a difference of 1.

the difference is ""CARE Ecuador""

can that be explained?

also how can Tei Wa Wo not have a date of joining?","10/10/11 10:54:26; ajaya;

count of Prospects is okay.
there are some that need to be rejected so they are out of the way. but its a process issue.

 water from a spring or a well on a higher altitude than the village flows to the village overhead water tank,
 using the principles of gravity from where it is again distributed through pipes to all families round the clock. Gram Vikas is innovating and experimenting with the gravity flow design to minimize costs and to maintain a round the clock water supply to rural homes especially in rural areas.Therefore people don't need to pay cost for electricity charges. People also collect O&M cost for future repair of pipelines and infrastructures put in place for water supply.

 ensuring 100% coverage at all times. "",

 ""learnings""=>""Process of Implementation:\r\nThe project is guided by five core values: inclusion,
 social equity,
 gender equity,
 sustainability and cost sharing. It uses water and sanitation as the entry point activity to unite the community . under this core rallying point the community is organised to take action to improve its well-being and environment. Before the programme begins in any village,
 the village must come to a consensus that all families,
 without exception,
 will participate. This brings the community together across barriers of caste,
 gender and economic status,
 which for centuries have excluded large sections of communities from the process of development. The village must also raise a corpus fund of Rs.1,
000 ($22) per household with the better-off paying more and the poorer less. The corpus fund is an acid test,
 demonstrating that the community is committed to the process of development. Interest from the Corpus fund is used to meet the social costs of extending the water and sanitation system to new households in the future,
 ensuring 100% coverage at all times. \r\nWomen and children are the greatest beneficiaries of this programme - women benefiting from being spared the drudgery of fetching water for household uses and children,
 escaping the clutches of water-borne diseases,
 which result in widespread morbidity and mortality.\r\nAccess to sanitation is not only a matter of hygiene,
 it is a statement in dignity - it restores to the rural folk,
 especially women,
 their self-respect and dignity and helps the community to improve their health status. \r\n"",
