Looks like i had a few minutes off between action and got a rails error.

Maybe we need to include Steve Chanin's suggestion:
Quick thing with respect to Peer Water exchange.  A couple of days back, I went to check out the site and saw a page that was blank except for the error message “Rails Application (error)”.  Clicking refresh brought up the home page correctly.

I had seen that same thing on some of my sites and discussions with people led me to understand that it is a side effect of the rails application server swapping out of memory due to low use (e.g. No one hitting it for a while) ... Then the first request to come in results in a longer than expected wait (between the web server and rails) which yields that error.  The second hit (e.g. the refresh) works correctly because a side effect of the timeout is a restart of the rails process.

In any case, there is a simple solution ... Setup a background process that hits the rails app every 5 minutes (has to be a dynamic page ... Not a static page).  That will keep the app in memory.

On linux, I just put an entry in the crontab:

    */5 * * * *     curl http://wpp.sapient.com >/dev/null 2>&1

And I haven’t seen the problem since.
"
3 bugs in application attachment,"1/ after you attach a document (not photo) on page 2 or page 3 and click 'Done' you return to the application draft (all 3 sections on 1 page and then you need to click 'edit'), not to the application page where you started.


2/ after attaching a spreadsheet (.xls) it shows a word icon on page 3

3/ i attached 2 docs (one .doc and .xls) on page 3 and when i clicked done, it went to application summary page.

it showed the 2 docs on the implementer section.

Clicking attach file without filling in fields properly gives rails error,"
in attach pictures, if:

1/ no file is specified and ""Attach"" is clicked by mistake before clicking browse, we get a rails error.

2/ an incorrect file is specified by just typing a file name that does not exist 

http://dev.peerwater.org/app/display_attach/141?type=photo
Application error (Rails)


we should check to see if a file is specified or if something is specified then it should not crash if file is not found.


3/ minor: tif files are not displayed, is this expected?",10/10/2011 09:36:17,10/10/2011 10:18:22,Closed,rajesh,ajaya,Upgrade www to Latest Code Base,Upgrade www to Latest Code Base,Fixed,"10/10/11 10:18:22; ajaya;

email on app submission missing,"
when an app is submitted an email used to go out to the submitter (bcc admin@).

the email template exists still.

however, email is not being sent.

email should come from system@ and that account was removed somehow. account is restored and now can get password reset from that account, but this one is missing.

remove cycle choosing dropdown on application,"for now it is too confusing and the functionality is not needed.

it is up to admin to ensure that there will never be 2 submissions active at any given point.

this drop down is in a couple of spots.

also when the user clicks done, it should always go to the application summary page: ""view_application_detail""
sometimes goes to dashboard and sometimes to summary.

from all pages it should go to the same page.

1/ on the application, there needs to be a radio button with 2 options:

2/ During edit/review, etc. this info should be clearly visible so needs to be on the forms to edit the app, on the forms to review the app

3/ When funding is granted, the process for the Single project should be completely transparent.

- when the funding is accepted, a project is created with the same data as the application
- the project has status 'not started' and is placed in the active projects category and in the todo with due date as the start date on the application.



TBD:
1/ status that is meaningful to the user (like ""enter start date"" ""submit mid-term report"" ""final status"" ...)

From the dashboard you can search for apps, projects, orgs.
Each page has a dropdown to allow the user to show a number of results per page.

For apps: 1, 5, 10 
For projects: 10, 25, 50, ALL
For orgs: 10, 25, 50, ALL

From admin dashboard:
For users: All, 10, 25, 50
For orgs: <nothing>
For projects: All, 10, 25, 50
For apps: 1, 5, 10


They all should be the same: 10, 25, All  with default being 10
The admin search pages should be the same as the members.


For app search: columns should be: name, status, org, country. (remove id.
Should not allow users to see drafts of other orgs. 
If it is easy, show drafts of the self; if not, let drafts be from home page.

For project search: columns should be: name, status, org, country. (remove id)

For org search: columns should be: name, country, type, user names (may have 2)

1. remove the RE: or add only 1. we don't need to see RE: RE: RE: now that indentation is working well.


2. the text entry box form for a reply needs to improve. the reply should work like post a new question (so at least you can see all the comments). basically, it should be good to see what you are responding to rather than having to remember it.


2a. either ajaxify so that the entry box is below the question that you are responding to

2b. make a reply like a new question at the bottom and not on its own page, without confusing them that they are putting in a new field.

Put PWX icon in url bar,"



To put an icon in the URL space of one of your own pages, make a very small image. By very small, it should be 16 X 16 pixels and it should only use 16 or 8 colors. The image should be a gif and it should be very basic or it'll be too small to look like anything. Once you have your image the way you want it, rename it to have the extension .ico instead of .gif. It needs to have the .ico extension to be viewed as an icon, and it needs to be an icon for this to work.

Then, use this code inbetween the HEAD tags of the page:

< link REL=""shortcut icon"" type=""image/x-icon"" HREF=""/path_to_image/pwxdrop-tiny.ico"" >

Check your page and you now have an icon. If you want the image to appear in someone's Internet Explorer Favorites links as an image, just name your image favicon.ico and it will work.

Review cycle/phase ending should end app status,"
if a review phase ends, the reviewer should not be able to review the app anymore.

this works in normal situation.

however, if a second cycle has started (no overlap in phases), the app stays on the dashboard if the reviewer has not finished reviewing.

once the app is submitted it should be tied to the cycle in which it is submitted (assuming there is no overlap). so when the review phase ends, the app needs to move out of the todo in the dashboard.

 2 | NOT INITIALIZED

 4 | COMPLETE ADMIN

2. The app will still be available to  review even after cycle end date if admin has done review.  So basically the screen doesn't care for cycle.  It only checks for status.  If it is less then 3 ( means in not intialized or inj progress ) then reviewer is allowed to review.

So. In my thought process. we need to document this proces better and after careful thought.  Why don't u try to pin your thoughts on the review process and then we can talk.","10/10/11 10:20:51; ajaya;

Multiple Uses of Water

Posted By Susan Davis of CARE at Fri Dec 15, 2006 09:17 AM US/California Time

I note that the plan is to use the harvested rainwater only for drinking. However we know that people need water to cook, wash, do laundry, etc. There is a hygiene education component to this program as well. How will people in the community be able to maintain good hygiene without access to adequate quantities of water? Have you considered multiple needs/uses of water and including training on point of use treatment for water from alternative sources that could be used for purposes other than drinking?
Multiple Uses of Water

Posted By Idriss Kamara of Safer Future at Fri Dec 15, 2006 09:17 AM US/California Time

The money collected can be used to refill the tank. The water supplied is coming from a water reservoir from the hilly and is drinking water too...

A lot of bug fixes into AppQanda.

Fix BUG 7292.
1. Manage Error in QandA
2. Rollback posting if error occurs
3. Comment out tiny_mce code for now
4. Add column in app_qandas table 'posted_by' to capture post dates instead of updated_at.  Nice Catch Anette.

This is deployed in QA now and needs to be tested well.  

We need to move www to latest code base as these changes have been cherry picked and causing real pain.  Let's talk.

Finer control of icons on the map,"
Each funding round should have icons that are distinct.
When a cycle is created the icons residing in a folder will be available for the admin to select for each phase in the cycle:

1/ submission phase
2/ peer review phase
3/ (Optional) limbo phase between application and project: granted/funded/accepted but projects not created
   this might be tricky for multi-project funding where outstanding funds are still available but some projects have been started
4/ project implementation phase
5/ (Options) project completed

Each phase, the icon can be selected from a list of all the icons in a special directory which can been updated easily (add new icon files).

It will be the responsibility of the admin to add new icons to the appropriate folder on the server and ensure their size, format, etc. matches the requirements. We should also specify the maximum size for our application and whether we recommend shadows or not.",10/10/2011 09:41:52,10/10/2011 10:22:05,Closed,rajesh,rajesh,Wish List,Wish List,Fixed,"10/10/11 10:21:50; ajaya; 
What would be an extended funding phase.  We don't capture that in current cycle creation.","10/10/11 10:21:53; rajesh; **Author: rajesh**
By ""extended funding phase"" i meant that we end the funding phase when the cycle ends. However, the projects are often in limbo for months, until they kick off (or the data on the kickoff is entered).

There can be a large gap between the application and the project and our map will not show it. Once the app is funded, the application icon is off the map. But until the project is kicked off, the project icon does not appear.

For multi-project this 'sitting funds' may last a long time; until they are all used up.

My comment was not to change cycle creation as much as to capture the time in between funding of an app and the project creation.

This is an optional request and also a discussion of any ideas to put pressure on the implementers to 'create' the project. Maybe use a '?' as an icon that reflects on the implementer (near their home icon).","10/10/11 10:21:55; ajaya;

The funding cycle should have a dropdown (or checkboxes) to choose which map selection it should be part of. Right now the selection should be 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
